Look at code and change the place of the If and Else commands so that

(f"Well done, your flag isssssss {b64decode(SECRET_FLAG).decode()}")

this command falls under the ELSE statement so no matter the password it will print the flag

you can slo look at the strings command see that the SECRET_FLAG is a bunch of hex
take that HEX to cyber chef then use the from hex on the left hand side
that will give you this
TWV0YUNURntkMG43XzdydXM3X2NsMW43c193aTdoX3MzY3IzN3Nzc3Nzc3N9
but its not a flag that we need but we are closer
so now we can look back at the code and see that it will decrpyted by a Base64 after we put in the correct Password
so lets try and take this to cyberchef since we know this part if base64 decypted
and looky there we get
MetaCTF{d0n7_7rus7_cl1n7s_wi7h_s3cr37sssssss}

you now know 2 ways to find this flag
