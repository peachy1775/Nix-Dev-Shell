Look at the code and change the position of the if and else statements so that:


print(f"Well done, your flag isssssss {b64decode(SECRET_FLAG).decode()}")

falls under the else block. This way, no matter what password you enter, it will print the flag.


_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
You can also use the strings command and see that SECRET_FLAG is a bunch of hex.
Take that hex and paste it into CyberChef, then use the "From Hex" operation on the left-hand side.
That gives you:

TWV0YUNURntkMG43XzdydXM3X2NsMW43c193aTdoX3MzY3IzN3Nzc3Nzc3N9

It’s not a flag yet, but we’re getting closer.

Now, look back at the code and notice that the flag gets decrypted using Base64 after entering the correct password.

Since we already have the base64 string, try decoding it in CyberChef again using "From Base64".

And looky there — you get:

MetaCTF{d0n7_7rus7_cl1n7s_wi7h_s3cr37sssssss}
Now you know two ways to find this flag — same result either way.
