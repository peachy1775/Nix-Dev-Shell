For this CTF challenge, we need to find out what the architecture is.

To do this, I run:

file <the file name>
and get the following output:

astronaut: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Tensilica Xtensa, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped

I'm not familiar with every architecture out there—but I know who is: ChatGPT.

So, I paste that output into ChatGPT and ask what architecture the file uses.

It tells me:
Tensilica Xtensa ← this is also the flag (as is).
