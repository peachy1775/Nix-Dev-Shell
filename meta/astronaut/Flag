For this CTf chal we need to find out what the architecture is

so for this i use file <the file name>
and i get this output
astronaut: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Tensilica Xtensa, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped

well im not keen on every architecture is out there but i know who is CHATGPT

so paste that into the CHATGPT and ask it what is the architecture of that file
and it will tell you it is
Tensilica Xtensa << this is also the flag as is >>
