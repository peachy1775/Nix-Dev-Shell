for this chal we are going to just use strings as the hint tell us 

when we run strings < the file >
we get so many we can look through them all

so we are going to just grep once again I know 

strings < the file > | grep picoCTF ( we know this part is in the flag)

then we get picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_be6031da}
