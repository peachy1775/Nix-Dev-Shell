For this challenge, we are just going to use strings, as the hint suggests.

When we run:

strings <the file>
we get so many results that we can't look through them all manually.

So, once again, we're going to use grep:


strings <the file> | grep picoCTF
(We know this part is in the flag.)

Then we get:


picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_be6031da}
